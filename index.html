When I first left the sea, I was overcome with heaviness.
<br /><br />Four arms searched for drier land, two kept close to my body if defense was needed and one dangled behind unsure of what was happening.
<br /><br />All squirmed under the pressure.
<br /><br />A white glare with a trail splitting the sky burnt my eyes down the middle.
<br /><br />I puddled like blubber and fumbled over the lollipop swirls of an air-facing reef.
<br /><br />On first look back to sea I saw life new, I'd never thought my world as blue before.

Moving further to a murmur inland, finds the source a jumble as I was, but unbending between joints.
<br /><br />Green, mostly.
<br /><br />Dark as black as parts got thinner.
<br /><br />Four uncoloured, thin fins stretched from it with fine, black lines searching for edges, and a limb of beads like a tentacle stuffed with pebbles stretching out from the inner bundling.
<br /><br />It wasn't until a fin slipped from its own grip that I noticed the hands - on arms as few as there were fins - relaxing from painting a fin red.
<br /><br />As it kept unfurling, the head peeked outward.
<br /><br />The green, bulbous eyes took up most of the head and seemed rippled over themselves many times, like the reef pools hit by paint drips.
<br /><br />Two antennae straight but tilting, signalling something I didn't understand.
<br /><br />All this a strain to see, I asked the thing when this blasted light will dim.
<br /><br />My words felt sluggish and piled upon each other like weed-ridden waves would overlap on the shore to make a louder crash.

I'd not seen anything but sand and cliff-face for a long-time.

<br /><br />Among much information I've forgotten, he told me his name was Anisoptera - but he prefers Aesop.
<br /><br />I shared mine as Haliphron.
<br /><br />He would call me Hali.
<br /><br />He did not walk evenly, the fall was little surprise, I was less struck by the ground and more by him finally shutting up.
<br /><br />Something frightened him, but it was a familiar sight to me.
<br /><br />An armoured warrior, much wider than he was tall, with massive claws and a shield on his back.
<br /><br />But he was covered in lichen, a stark tangle over him compared to the sugar-piles of sand dunes.
<br /><br />He was not moving much, Aesop likely mistook him for a rock until he had shifted to turn away from us.

I woke to a gentle shifting of my water-filled bag. Two of my arms felt the hands of Aesop at the straps so I was not startled.
It was when I heard him whisper to not make a sound that I became afraid.
<br /><br />Reaching out my arms I found nothing but rock and dirt.
<br /><br />Opening my eyes I saw at the side of the cave mouth a white and pink thing of a great finspan but they seemed to have long bones within to keep the fins spread.
<br /><br />The body of the creature was a small thing in comparison and could be wrapped up within the fins.
<br /><br />The head was snouted with small sharp fangs, covered in a yellow slime which a long tongue is continuously lapping up.
<br /><br />Less noticeably next to it was a cloak, black as a starless median sky but with similar white strands and pink flaps of a creature peeking out from within.
<br /><br />The one in the dark shroud seemed the only one speaking as the other was transfixed on drinking up the stream of thick and yellow sludge.

"Yes I recall your names. No-one in our known history has cohorently defined the shape of our world yet, so navigating it is a confusing task, aside from saying you are following the pulses or going against. But what if you don't go along the pulse and instead to the side? I call this angle from the pulse direction the spin angle. Many say you can't really move that way as they don't see it affect the pulselight but we do seem to be able to move from each other that way. Maybe the pulselight wouldn't change as we expect. What if the pulselight sees what we thought of as lateral movement as a rotation instead, a walking around it like it is a sort of center to things. With this theory, you can get back to where you are even quicker by an entirely different path. If we live in a donut plane, we can fix our great supply chain issues by calculating the ideal spin angle for the fastest pathways the chain can span for pollenation and delivery. Everyone could even can change where they live based on the spin angle to be in a better line of delivery for what they need as everything constantly circulates, like a rotating helix about the pulselight. And for those of us with wings, we could fly directly into the sky and it would be the same as walking a greater length around the pulselight-".

We would see ourselves looking at ourselves. Not a reflection. Not a projection. Literal reality from two directions just like the pulse light does - but over a shorter distance this time.

It feeds to a delicate spiking of chocolate spires pittered with holes housing whole mountains of talkative termites.
See them rise in organised compromise, where their edge is a barely-taken bitemark on the edge of a cookie, left for others to try.
And like crumbs in many number skittered from heat-soaked rock to shrubbery frock that dresses the foot of the sea-shell mountain, lizards and geckos littered on stucco have savoured no more than morning light allotted.
The fleeing pulse has angled its shadows, so shading green is the shallow and cool black is the deeps of the swamplands, where birds and bullfrogs are happy to sing all day for you.
I'm told their singing follows the beat of the drumming emus, a summing in melody and constancy to move an evening along.
That sound must scale the tower of spine keep, where the magus platypus preserves the gentle grazings of all echidna. Observing the farm always, except to see the pulselight wink at him each night.
